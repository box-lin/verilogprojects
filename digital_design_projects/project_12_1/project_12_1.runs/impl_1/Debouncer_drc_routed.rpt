2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net nolabel_line28/clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin nolabel_line28/Q_i_1/O, cell nolabel_line28/Q_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net nolabel_line28/clk_out_reg_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin nolabel_line28/clk_out_reg_LDC_i_1/O, cell nolabel_line28/clk_out_reg_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT nolabel_line28/Q_i_1 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
d1/Q_reg, d2/Q_reg
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
